# `undockerify` (command)

Usage:

> `undockerify` *imageName*

[*Source*](../../bin/undockerify)

Create a Rasperry Pi boot image file from a `pi` docker container named *imageName*.

The created image is not exported (see [`export-image`](../cmds/export-image.md)), so
additional setup may be performed.
